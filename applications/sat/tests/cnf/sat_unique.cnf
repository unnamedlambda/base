c Unique solution SAT: 6 vars, 18 clauses
c Has exactly one satisfying assignment: x1=T,x2=F,x3=T,x4=F,x5=T,x6=F
c True literals: {1, -2, 3, -4, 5, -6}
c Every other assignment violates at least one clause.
c Constructed by adding clauses that block all neighbors of the solution.

c Exclude flipping x1: block (F,F,T,F,T,F) -> need clause with (1) in any assignment with -1
c If x1=F, one of these must catch it:
1 2 0
1 -3 0
1 4 0
c Exclude flipping x2: block (T,T,T,F,T,F) -> need -2 in relevant clauses
-2 -1 0
-2 -3 0
-2 4 0
c Exclude flipping x3: block (T,F,F,F,T,F)
3 2 0
3 4 0
3 -5 0
c Exclude flipping x4: block (T,F,T,T,T,F)
-4 -1 0
-4 -3 0
-4 6 0
c Exclude flipping x5: block (T,F,T,F,F,F)
