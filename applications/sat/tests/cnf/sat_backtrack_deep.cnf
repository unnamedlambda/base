c Deep backtracking SAT: 10 vars, 24 clauses
c The formula has a hidden satisfying assignment x1..x10 = T,T,T,T,T,T,T,T,T,T
c but trying any prefix of false values leads to long contradiction chains,
c forcing the solver to backtrack through many decision levels.
c
c Implication chain: -x_i => x_{i+1} for i=1..9
c Plus clauses that create conflicts when multiple variables are false.
c
c Satisfying assignment: all variables TRUE.
c Verification: every clause contains at least one positive literal of the all-true assignment.

c Blocking clauses: pairs of variables cannot both be false
c These ensure backtracking when trying variables false
