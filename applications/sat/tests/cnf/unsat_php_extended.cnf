c UNSAT: Pigeonhole 3->2 with extended variable count
c Same as pigeonhole 3 into 2, but with 4 extra "dummy" variables (7-10)
c that appear in additional clauses. The formula is still UNSAT because
c the core pigeonhole constraints are unsatisfiable regardless of x7-x10.
c Tests that extra variables and wider clauses don't fool the solver.
c 10 vars, 15 clauses
p cnf 10 15
c Pigeon 1 in at least one hole (extended with dummies)
1 2 7 0
c Pigeon 2 in at least one hole (extended with dummies)
3 4 8 0
c Pigeon 3 in at least one hole (extended with dummies)
5 6 9 0
c No two pigeons in hole 1
-1 -3 0
-1 -5 0
-3 -5 0
c No two pigeons in hole 2
-2 -4 0
-2 -6 0
-4 -6 0
c Dummy vars cannot substitute for holes: force them false
-7 0
-8 0
-9 0
c Extra wide clause (always satisfied, but adds noise)
1 2 3 4 5 6 10 0
c Extra constraint involving dummy
