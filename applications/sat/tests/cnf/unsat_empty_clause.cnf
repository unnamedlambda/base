c Empty clause edge case: UNSAT
c A formula with an empty clause is trivially unsatisfiable.
c NOTE: The DIMACS representation of an empty clause is just "0" on a line.
c Some parsers may skip empty clauses (lit_count=0). If the solver's parser
c skips it, this test verifies whether the solver handles this correctly.
c The remaining clauses (x1) and (-x1) are also UNSAT by themselves,
c so the formula is UNSAT regardless of empty clause handling.
