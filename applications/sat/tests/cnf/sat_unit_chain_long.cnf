c Long unit propagation chain: 15 vars, 15 clauses
c Unit clause x1=T triggers a chain of 14 forced implications:
c   x1=T => x2=T => x3=T => ... => x15=T
c Each step: clause (-x_i, x_{i+1}) becomes unit after x_i is set true.
c Plus a final clause requiring x15 to confirm the chain completes.
c Satisfying assignment: all variables TRUE (forced, unique solution).
