c Pure literal SAT: 8 vars, 10 clauses
c Variables 1,2,3 only appear positive (pure positive)
c Variables 6,7,8 only appear negative (pure negative)
c Variables 4,5 appear in both polarities (mixed)
c A solver with pure literal elimination should immediately set:
c   x1=T, x2=T, x3=T (only positive), x6=F, x7=F, x8=F (only negative)
c Then the remaining clauses on x4,x5 are easily satisfiable.
c Satisfying assignment: x1=T,x2=T,x3=T,x4=T,x5=T,x6=F,x7=F,x8=F
