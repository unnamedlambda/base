c Tautological clauses mixed with real constraints: 5 vars, 8 clauses (SAT)
c Clauses 1,3,5 are tautological (contain both x and -x), always true.
c The remaining clauses form a satisfiable formula.
c A correct solver should recognize tautological clauses as trivially satisfied
c and not let them interfere with the real constraints.
c Satisfying assignment: x1=T, x2=T, x3=T, x4=F, x5=T
