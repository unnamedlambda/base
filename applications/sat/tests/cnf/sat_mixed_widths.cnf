c Mixed widths: single-literal clauses mixed with wide clauses (SAT)
c 10 vars, 12 clauses
c Tests that the solver handles a mix of unit clauses (width 1),
c binary clauses (width 2), and wide clauses (width 5-8) correctly.
c Unit clauses force x1=T, x2=T immediately.
c Satisfying assignment: x1=T,x2=T,x3=T,x4=T,x5=T,x6=F,x7=T,x8=F,x9=T,x10=F
